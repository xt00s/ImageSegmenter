## Credits

The interface of the program is mainly adopted from the great web util from this [video][3]. Additionally when searching segmentation tools available i came across  [Interactive Segmentation Tool][4] - the util that does automatic graph-based binary segmentation and decided to include the same tool (Segmentation Pencil tool) in the program.
